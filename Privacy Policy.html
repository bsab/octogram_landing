            <p>One of our core company values is privacy. We feel your privacy and that of your children is paramount, and this Privacy Policy sets out the way in which we collect, manage and protect your data.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Octogram service (the “Service”) through our website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.octogramapp.com">www.octogramapp.com</a>&nbsp;, applications and on Devices. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Octogram Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Octogram Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Information We Collect And Store</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Octogram Service:</p>
            <p>Information You Provide. When you register for an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name and email address. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing your Octogram data with them.</p>
            <p>Log Data. When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>
            <p>Cookies. We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Personal Information: In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalise and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings. Geo-Location Information: Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps collect such information with your consent to improve our Service. Some photos and videos you store in Octogram may already contain recorded location information. We may use this information to optimise your experience. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.</p>
            <p>Analytics: We also collect some information using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyse use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorisation needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">here</a>, and to learn how to opt out of that service click&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your Use. Any information and content you choose to share in Octogram should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information and content you share. You can review and revise who can access your Octogram at any time in Settings. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below).</p>
            <p>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others. We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyse, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your Files). You can find more information on Amazon’s data security from the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/articles/1697">S3 site</a>.</p>
            <p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Octogram’s Rights. We may disclose to parties outside Octogram files stored in your Octogram and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Octogram or its users; or (d) to protect Octogram’s property rights.</p>
            <p>Business Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>
            <p>Non-private or Non-Personal Information. We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Data Retention</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may request that we delete your account by emailing us. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>Security</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a password) on forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@octogramapp.com">support@octogramapp.com</a>.</p>
            <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Contacting Us</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@octogramapp.com">support@octogramapp.com</a>.</p>
            <ol start="8">
                <li><strong>Changes to our Privacy Policy</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
