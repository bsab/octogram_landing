            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Octogram (and any licensors of Octogram) own(s) all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, all software comprising a part of the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that the rights in the Service, including all intellectual property rights, are protected by one or more of copyright, trade mark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and treaties, in addition to these Terms of Service. Except for the limited license rights specifically granted to you in these Terms of Service, Octogram and its licensors own and shall retain all rights, title and interest, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, in and to the Service and all software utilised therein (and all copies thereof and related materials that are provided or made available to you with the Service).</p>
            <p>In order to enable Octogram to operate the Service, we need to obtain from you a licence and other rights to the Content you submit (so that our processing, maintenance, storage, technical reproduction, back-up, transmission, distribution and display, and related handling of your Content does not infringe applicable copyright, intellectual property and other laws). Accordingly, by using the Service and posting Content, you grant Octogram a license to display, perform, transmit and distribute your Content, and to modify (for technical purposes) and reproduce such Content to enable Octogram to operate the Service. (You also agree that Octogram has the right to elect not to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any Content in our sole discretion.)

            <p>Your Rights</p>
            <p>As indicated above, you retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Service.

You agree that you are solely responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Octogram has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
            <p>Octogram hereby grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Software provided to you by Octogram as part of the Service as provided to you by Octogram, for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as permitted by these Terms of Service, until your rights are terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service.</p>

                <li><strong>GENERAL TERMS</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>(a) These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Octogram and governs your use of the Service. These Terms of Service, as in effect from time to time, supersedes any prior agreements or earlier versions of these Terms of Service between you and Octogram for the use of the Service. If, through accessing or using the Service, you utilise or obtain any product or service from a third party, you may additionally be subject to such third party’s terms and conditions applicable thereto, and these Terms of Service shall not affect your legal relationship with such third party.</p>
            <p>(b) You acknowledge and agree that each affiliate of Octogram shall be a third party beneficiary to these Terms of Service and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of these Terms of Service which confers a benefit on (or provides rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be a third party beneficiary to these Terms of Service. (c) These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Octogram shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Octogram agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within England and Wales. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Octogram shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any applicable jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>(d) The failure or delay by Octogram to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service or rights under applicable law shall not constitute a waiver of any such provisions or rights. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect. (e) You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or related to use of the Service or otherwise under these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing such claim.</p>
            <p>(f) The section headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>
